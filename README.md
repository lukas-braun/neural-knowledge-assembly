# Neural knowledge assembly in humans and neural networks

This repository contains the official implementation of the neural network simulations of the [Neuron](https://www.cell.com/neuron/home) paper "Neural knowledge assembly in humans and neural networks".


## Requirements

Experiments are implemented in python using [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) for neural network simulations.

To install all required libaries run

```setup
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Replicating results

In order to replicate the experiments and corresponding figures use the ipython notebooks:
- neural-network-assembly.ipynb,
- remerge.ipynb,
- replay.ipynb.
